From the opinion of Pythagoras as brought to us by Aelian in Book 12 Chapter 59, there are two things which when exhibited by man make him like the immortal God, *being true* and *doing good*: And this assertion doubtlessly is better by far and more elegant than this entire disputation of our Strabo — that is, of a man dedicated to the Stoic school of thought, which is what is different from Epicureanism

You may not easily judge what is different from the dogma of Epicurus

The proverb *homo homini Deus* is relevant to this point. (See the end of Cicero's oration *Pro Ligario*.) — Casaubon
